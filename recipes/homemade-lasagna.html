    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch
      tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade
      lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a
      blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Serve with a leafy green
      salad and crusty garlic bread.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade
      lasagna recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat: </strong>
        <span>
          This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground
          pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion: </strong>
        <span>
          A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Canned tomatoes: </strong>
        <span>
          You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh herbs: </strong>
        <span>
          For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove
          of garlic.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar: </strong>
        <span>
          A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings: </strong>
        <span>
          This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano,
          salt, and black pepper.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Noodles: </strong>
        <span>
          Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked
          noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese: </strong>
        <span>
          The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll
          also need shredded mozzarella.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs: </strong>
        <span>
          Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding
          agent (which means they hold the layer together).
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
